# Unobserved Components Model

The unobserved components model is a semi-structural model since you give defined structure to the trend and the cycle as time series. For now I will treat two variants of the unobserved components model: constant, and stochastic drift. 

## Constant drift

Consider the following system of equations:

```math
y_{t} = \tau_{t} + c_{t}
```
