# Time-Series-Filters
This is a small project I am doing while I learn from diverse time series methods. 

This repository will mainly have time series filtering methods such as: Hodrick Prescott, Baxter King, Butterworth, Christiano Fitzgerald, Beveridge Nelson. 

When I have covered most of the time series filters provided by stata, I will create a package with these functions. Feel free to use them. 

Jorge.
