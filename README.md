# Time-Series-Filters
This is a small project I am doing while I learn from diverse time series methods. 

This repository will mainly have time series filtering methods such as Linear, Hodrick Prescott (and its modifications), Baxter King, Butterworth, Christiano Fitzgerald, Beveridge Nelson, Kalman filter, and others.

When I have covered most of the time series filters provided by stata (replications in R), I will create a package with these functions. Feel free to use them but cite this repository.

Jorge.
